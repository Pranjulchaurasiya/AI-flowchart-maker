# AI Flowchart Maker

A web-based application that generates flowcharts automatically from text prompts, instructions, or uploaded files. The tool converts natural language descriptions into structured flowcharts with a clean and intuitive user interface. It supports customization, real-time editing, and export options for PDF, PNG, and SVG formats.

## How the System Works

1. User enters a prompt, lines, or structured instructions.
2. The backend processes the text using the text parser.
3. AI-based flowchart generator creates nodes and edges.
4. The layout engine arranges elements cleanly.
5. The frontend displays the flowchart on a canvas.
6. Users can edit, move, or customize flowchart nodes.
7. The export service converts the final flowchart into PDF, SVG, or PNG.

## Unique Selling Points

* Reduces manual flowchart creation time significantly.
* Offers clean and tidy layouts with automated spacing.
* Suitable for students, developers, educators, and professionals.
* Works with natural language, making it accessible to non-technical users.
* Lightweight and fast due to optimized layout algorithms.

---

## Future Enhancements

* Support for complex workflows and branching logic.
* Live collaboration mode for teams.
* Cloud storage integration.
* Authentication system for user accounts.
* Version history and auto-save.
* Integration with documentation tools.
